# WebComposer

Reader form several web sites to collect interesting info and group just in one place, in this example Weather from Spain

## execution
A shortcut has been created in *webcomposer.sh*, so you can run:
> ./webcomposer.sh

to work with screenshots or:
> ./webcomposer.sh -f

to work with iframes.

Basically, it cleans the previous files, run the script and open the result.

*webcomposer.kts* and *webscreenshots.kts* are self-executables so you can use:
> ./webcomposer.kts

it works with *kscript* so alternatively you can use:
> kscript webcomposer.kts

you can ensure kscript is working on your computer with:
> kscript --help

and install it with:
> brew upgrade holgerbrandl/tap/kscript

## Interesting notes
Jsoup is an really useful library to manage html. Info about Jsoup: https://github.com/jhy/jsoup/

To work with screenshot, Selenium (with ChromeDriver) has been chosen. The behaviour changes with a visual browser vs headless one.

Interesting info about corutines:

Interesting info about chromedriver:
To install, you could donwload the same version than your current chrome here: https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html
In my case, I choose chromedriver_mac64.zip and it should override the previous version, to ease this process I move this file to ~/ejecutables/chromedriver.
This works due to there is symbolic link in /usr/local/bin.
